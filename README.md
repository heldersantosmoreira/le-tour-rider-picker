# Le Tour Rider Picker

Small web application made to support me and my friends' in our own Le Tour de France fantasy league.

## How to run it locally?

Assuming you have the [required](.ruby-version) Ruby version and you have [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
ruby app.rb
```
